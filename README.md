A sample of how one can try to hard translate a webpage

This is a sample project which can and has served as a base for a full fledged project to hard translate an entire website to a preferred language.
This can also serve as a starter for projects needing to manage text and tags on website.


For full fledged websites , one might need to setup parameters and run this script recursively through all html files.
Also , keep mind of the tags included in the original script , you'll need to add/remove tags as per requirements.

index.htm is original webpage that was translated using the script provided.
Translated file : index_trans.html
